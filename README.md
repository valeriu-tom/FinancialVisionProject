This is a simple example of using financial data to train a convolutional neural network, with the goal to recognize images representing candlesticks patterns.
First, a gramian angular filed approach is used to encode a time series representing a financial asset -- this example utlizes ethereum -- as different types of images. 
Secondly, the newly generated gaf images are used as inputs for a CNN, in order to learn several of the most well known candelsticks patterns. 
This approach was inspired by this paper: https://jfin-swufe.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40854-020-00187-0
This is the first example in a series of several, more complex models, pertaining to financial vision and financial modeling in general.
